        # Why are we doing this?
        # The resource code will need to take care of - does the resource I am about ready to create exist (examples)
        # Does the route 53 record with Name X already exist- if so Fail out creating the resource
        # Should I create that Transit gateway route -
        #   interrogate the routes first and see if we should fail to create because of existence.

        # What about resources like an AD Trust While the resource_identifier could be a trust id - The custom
        # resource will have to ask the question - does a trust exist with this directory with the same name - if so
        # fail out.

        # We have 2 fundamental problems with this current implementation above - with or without prepended stack id and
            logical resource id
        # If we dont prepend with stack info -
        # We are hoping all unique identifiers across all applications we ever integrate with are unique across any
        service AWS/Security/Azure/Random Webservice Integration - that seems like hope and dreams and no way to enforce
        # If we DO prepend with stack info
        # Now resources will almost never run into eachother, but we are putting the onus on the developer to not create
            something that may not be unique.
        # For example - If developer has to create an AD group in stack1 and tries to create an ad group in stack 2 with
            same name, at the dynamo DB level nothing will fail with this design.  The developer will have to do the
            work to ensure no onverlap

        # If the developer in previous use case used the primary identifier of ad group name - that would in fact work -
        but with the N number of custom resources planned we would almost certaintly eventually have a collission with
        primary identifiers - especially if they can be human parameters like trusted domain name.  The only way we
        could guarantee no collission is a separate Dynamo Table per custom resource - this would guarantee the "alike"
         primary identifiers are only being compared with eachother.  Then its up to the implementor to pick good
         primary identifiers.

        # A seperate Dynamo table per resource feels like overkill - Technically possible - but it would guarantee no
        overlap.  That would allow us to implement each resource in a way where we wouldnt have to do "as much"
        defensive programming.  But it doesnt solve it completely.

        # Take the trust issue with AD again.  While the trust ID would be unique.  The trust is a singleton from a
        name perspective.  So you can only have N trust names to one directoryid but you cant have the same trust name
         times 2 to one directory.  That will require defensive programming

        # An example where we wouldnt have thte problem is ACM - You can request N number of certs with the same name
        but the DNS records to verify are always unique.  In this case however - one table per resource would HELP on
        the collission issue.

        # So what do we do?
        # The reason we are implementing custom resources is because either AWS failed us or we are integrating with
        other APIs.  Another use case is we need to read auto created resource info.
        # The reason we are doing dynamo DB work is because we need to honor the contract tests specifically for RO
        resources.  That is not in scope for this method

        # Decision:
        # The simplest to implemnent answer feels like the right path - Use a single table - dump all resources in there
         that are almost guaranteed to be unique and use defensive programming in each custom resource.  Each custom
         resource will have to do some kind of defensive programming anyways - so lets just assume it will happen
         anyways.  This will keep the dynamo db layer simpler and easier to think about.
